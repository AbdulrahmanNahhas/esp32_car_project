# Car Project

## Requirments:
- ESP32
- Car Kit (4 Rpm Motor and Wheel Set + Battery)
- Pair Motor Driver Board with a Voltage Regulator (L298N)
- NEO-6MV2 GPS Module
- Ultrasonic sensor

## Project Components:
| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| GPIO | General Purpose Input Output is an interface that allows you to read and write digital signals from and to pins on a microcontroller.  |
| GPS | Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that allows you to determine the car's location on Earth. GPS receivers can be used to track your location in real-time or to store your location for later use. |
| Motor_Control | Motor control components allow you to control the speed and direction of motors. |
| Nimble | Nimble is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack that allows you to develop BLE devices. |
| Ultrasonic |  Ultrasonic distance sensors are used to measure the distance to an object by emitting and detecting ultrasonic sound waves.  |
